Currently this thing is only made for Android, apps for the other two platforms coming soon.

My part of the code (heavily inspirated by @pierceboggan's [Moments](https://github.com/pierceboggan/Moments/)) is licensed under the MIT license. But it also uses other Open Source components that may have their's own license.
